It's dark in here ! Noir is probably *the* simplest way to write a functional web application in clojure.

This is how it looks like in Clojure code

@@@ ruby 08_noir.clj @@@

and/or this is how you would have it started in a few seconds with the leiningen command we installed earlier on

@@@ ruby 09_noir.sh @@@

Now the guy from Noir has also started a very cute project named [Lighttable](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table). You can see the [Playground](http://app.kodowa.com/playground) where you can do live execution of your code with an awesome new type of UI for programming.

### Vaadin, or Google Web Toolkit without all the plumbery, just with the fun

This is not so much a library than a way to develop slick web application using Vaadin, but without the java boiler plate code. 

#### Sample Vaadin Application to get started
