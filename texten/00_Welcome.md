### Why would even I need Clojure now ? 

Clojure is a rather new programming language, that appeared in 2007, created by Rich Hickey, originally targeting the Java Virtual Machine. While Java had and still has its up and down, and some times a clunky syntax, the virtual Machine it runs on is one of the best multi core ready environment for computing.

Clojure turns itself into (byte-)code that the Java Virtual Machine fully understands, and runs, as well as enhance performance of the most used part of your programs. 

Clojure is not the only language to run on the Virtual Machine. Other famous and well performing languages like Scala, JRuby (a Ruby implementation implemented in Java). While those languages have also their strength, we the authors feel that Clojure is not only going to make your life easier, it will also change the way your think and create software, or whatever it is your want to create. 

Once you have master Clojure, you have gained not only speed, but also clarity, and taste for what you deliver.

### Theme and approach of the book

This book will focus on presenting Clojure libraries and some easy and well performing tricks. Clojure as a diverse and vast platform can actually run a large set of libraries by just integrating with Java, .NET, Javascript or others. We will also present how to go beyond boundaries and how to use your Clojure knowledge wherever you go.

This is a book targeted at young and not so young engineers to help them acquire the Clojure ecosystem as fast as possible. The ecosystem is quite large, and can be overwhelming for new comers.By providing runnable examples, applications and a powerful set of libraries out of the box, this book hopes the reader will find some interest into having fun and running the piece of code by himself. 

### About the authors

*Nicolas Modrzyk* has implemented Clojure application over time, highly distributed, and they have been doing great under stressful loads.
I definitely think Clojure, under its different forms, is a one awesome knife to have into the whole set of weapons you need to be a successful independent contractor.

A few application examples would be:

* Multi-cores processing Settlements application integrating with distributed messaging queues and complex trading systems.
* Heavily threaded Web based configuration management, monitoring and deployment application. 
* Very fast to-market implementation of a social Platform service, using websockets and MongoDB on Heroku

And also countless command line scripts.

### What will you be achieve with this book

* The Clojure build tool, Leiningen, setup and down to earth usage
* Common libraries for your everyday programming tasks
* How to create user interfaces interactively 
* How to quickly create web application
* How to connect to the most famous agile middlewares: RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, Storm ...
* How to write Clojure-like OpenGL, and do some live 3D programming
* How to do music as data programming
* How to interface with Arduino 
* How to interface with Processing
* How to interface with common cloud platforms
* Some introduction on how to use Clojure for Android programming
