### Why would even I need Clojure now ? 

Clojure is a rather new programming language, that appeared in 2007, created by Rich Hickey, originally targeting the Java Virtual Machine. While Java had and still has its up and down, and some times a clunky syntax, the virtual Machine it runs on is one of the best multi core ready environment for computing. 
Clojure turns itself into (byte-)code that the Java Virtual Machine fully understands, and runs, as well as enhance performance of the most used part of your programs. 
Clojure is not the only language to run on the Virtual Machine. Other famous and well performing languages like Scala, JRuby (a Ruby implementation implemented in Java)

This book will focus on presenting Clojure libraries and some easy tricks. Clojure as a diverse and vaste plateform can actually run a large set of libraries by just integrating with Java, .NET or others.
This is a book targeted at young and not so young engineers to help them acquire the Clojure ecosystem as fast as possible. The ecosystem is quite large, and quite a bit of documentation is outdated or not so useful anymore. By providing runnable examples, applications and a set of libraries out of the box, this book hopes the reader will find some interest into having fun and running the piece of code by himself.
