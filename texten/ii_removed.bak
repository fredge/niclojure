[clarsec](https://github.com/jasonjckn/clarsec), 

--> outdated ?

### Deploying clojure app in the cloud with jetlastic. it's super easy !

Along the lines of deploying a war file in the Cloud, Jetlastic has done some pretty award-type job recently and even put some detailed documentation on how to get Clojure started with Jetlastic.

Jetlastic also has special Japanese support and there is a Japanese provider right beside your door at:

    https://app.jelastic.tsukaeru.net/

What's more ? The Clojure Documentation at:

[http://jelastic.com/ja/docs/clojure)](http://jelastic.com/ja/docs/clojure) 

is pretty to the point and easy to understand, and Chas Emerick has created a [sample app](https://github.com/cemerick/clojure-web-deploy-conj) for you to use and deploy.
