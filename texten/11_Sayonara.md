## This is not the end

This is it. This is the *not the end*.

We have finished kegs and kegs of wine of all possible different colors. Our stomach is full, we can't even eat a single piece of Chocolate, and even the _other stomach_ would need surgery before eating more food.

Actually writing the book you hold in your hand was hard. Not because I do not like writing, not even because I lost interest.

No.

It took an enormous amount of motivation and focus to keep moving at a pace that would eventually lead to ... this section.

The funny thing is, I actually bought more books during the writing of this one, than any other time in my life.

It has been a long and fruitful journey writing this, I hope you had a long and fruitful journey having fun with all the examples we have gathered.

What we also hope is that from now now, you will be one of those creating and contributing to projects we have highlighted.

We have received enormous support from people around us, and this was probably this yet the most rewarding part of the work, until you come and ring our bell with some delicious wine.

Sayonara.
