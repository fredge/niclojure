### Cloduino

Once you have uploaded the Firmata protocol on your board
<code>
File -> Examples -> Firmata -> StandartFirmata
</code>

You can send a Clojure SOS.

There are so many more great [Samples](http://nakkaya.com/clodiuno.html) that Nakkaya has been writing. Make sure you go through them.

Another way to have fun, is to hack a [REPL connecting to your Roomba](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/wordpress/?p=450) robot !!

### Going native
[Clojure Native](https://github.com/bagucode/clj-native)
have a look at:
[https://github.com/Chouser/clojure-jna](https://github.com/Chouser/clojure-jna)
but it seems broken

### Monkeys like gaming, so does Clojure: Gaming

A long time I ago, just around 10, I picked up a book on [Game theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). I was a lot into Role Playing games at the time, and thought that this was going to help me design more entertaining games for those role playing sessions. Little did I know I was completely off. It did take me some time to read the different explanations and was quite soon on the path to be very interested into the process of decision making.
