### Incanter

[Download](http://incanter.org/downloads/) and [Get started](https://github.com/liebke/incanter/wiki#getstarted)

The download above includes a bunch of stuff you may not need. A faster way to get started is to go the usual route with Leiningen
<code>
[incanter "1.3.0"]
</code>

Then you can play around:

Whats your next diagram ? 

### Marginalia 
[https://github.com/fogus/marginalia](https://github.com/fogus/marginalia)

Marginalia is your best literate programming tool for clojure.  

Install it as a dependency in your project.clj file:

<code>
	:dev-dependencies [lein-marginalia "0.7.1"]
</code>

Then, just use it:
<code>
	lein marg
</code>

And dependending on the amount of comments you wrote in the code, you will get something similar to this:
