### Quil

[https://github.com/quil/quil](https://github.com/quil/quil)

Quil is to [Processing](http://processing.org/) what Clojure is to Java, some fresh air.

This is how your quil-ed processing sketch now looks like:

@@@ ruby 10_quil.clj @@@

Note the decor set to false, that hides most of the uglyness of the Window borders.

And all the [examples](https://github.com/quil/quil/tree/master/examples/gen_art) you have ever dreamed from the Generative Art book have been implemented in Clojure/Quil.
