This book will focus on presenting libraries and tricks targeted at the clojure plateform. Clojure as a plateform can actually run quite a large set of libraries by just integrating with Java, .NET or others.
This is a book targeted at young and not so young engineers to help them acquire the Clojure ecosystem as fast as possible. The ecosystem is quite large, and quite a bit of documentation is outdated or not so useful anymore. By providing runnable examples, and a set of libraries out of the box, this book hopes the reader will find some interest into having fun and running the piece of code by himself. 

### Myself

Personally I have implemented Clojure based application over time, on multi-cores and distributed application, and it never failed, so I think this one awesome knife to have into the whole set of weapons you need to be independant contractor.

A few application examples would be:

* Multi-cores processing Setlements application integrating with distributed messaging queues and complex trading systems
* Heavily threaded Web based configuration management, monitoring and deployment application 
* Very fast to-market implementation of a social Plateform service, using websockets and MongoDB on Heroku

### What this book will cover

* Clojure quick recipies that I myself use regularly
* Leiningen setup
* Common libraries for common programming tasks
