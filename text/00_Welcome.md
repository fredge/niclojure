### Why Clojure the lucky stiff

Clojure is a rather new programming language, targeting the Java Virtual Machine. While Java has its up and down, and some times a not so pretty syntax, the virtual Machine it runs own is one of the best multi core ready environment for computing.

This book will focus on presenting Clojure libraries and some easy tricks. Clojure as a diverse and vaste plateform can actually run a large set of libraries by just integrating with Java, .NET or others.
This is a book targeted at young and not so young engineers to help them acquire the Clojure ecosystem as fast as possible. The ecosystem is quite large, and quite a bit of documentation is outdated or not so useful anymore. By providing runnable examples, applications and a set of libraries out of the box, this book hopes the reader will find some interest into having fun and running the piece of code by himself. 

### About the authors

Personally I have implemented Clojure application over time, highly distributed, and they have been doing great under stressful loads.
I definitely think Clojure, under its different forms, is a one awesome knife to have into the whole set of weapons you need to be a successful independant contractor.

A few application examples would be:

* Multi-cores processing Setlements application integrating with distributed messaging queues and complex trading systems
* Heavily threaded Web based configuration management, monitoring and deployment application 
* Very fast to-market implementation of a social Plateform service, using websockets and MongoDB on Heroku

But also some command liene scripts.

### What this book will cover

* Clojure quick recipies that I myself use regularly
* The Clojure build tool, Leiningen, setup and down to earth usage
* Common libraries for your everyday programming tasks
* How to create user interfaces interactively 
* How to quickly create web application
* How to connect to the most famous agile middlewares: RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, Storm ...
* How to write Clojure-like OpenGL, and do some live 3D programming
* How to do music as data programming
* How to interface with Arduino 
* How to interface with Processing
* How to interface with common cloud plateforms
* Some introduction on how to use clojure for Android programming
* Present Clojure for the .NET plateform and ClojureScript

Thema:
This book will not focus so much on the language, as to what you can easily do through the fantastic Clojure ecosystem.
It has been observed by a number of people that programming is now more about connecting libraries than writing elegant solutions to problems.
