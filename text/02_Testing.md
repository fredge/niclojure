### I will test some of that

#### You are lazy. Use lazytest

####  You are not a midjet, so you use midje to test 
[Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje)

Midge is a fantastic move in the world of Test Driven Development. Midge not only makes testing your code fun, it gives you the right mindset to do experiment and testing in your own project.

To install Midge:
<code>
lein plugin install lein-midje 1.0.10
</code>

####  Web sites easy testing with selenium
[https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver/wiki](https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver/wiki)

"This library leverages the Selenium-WebDriver Java library to drive real GUI browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer, providing both a thin wrapper over the WebDriver API as well as higher-level Clojure functions to make interacting with the browser easier."

<code>
[clj-webdriver "0.6.0-alpha11"]
</code>

When in need for some integrated testing using clojure, especially on website that do not have a public API.  Here is an example showing I forgot my github password. :)

There is a very nice [blog post](http://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/automated-browser-based-testing-with-clojure) entry that shows how to use the API in more details.
